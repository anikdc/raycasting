# Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique that helps us to get a 3D perspective from 2D map. This technique was used in early videogames such as Wolfenstein3D.

In addition to the simple raycasting engine, I have added features for player tracking using the minimap and added textures. If you are looking for just the basic barebones implementation of raycasting check out [this branch](https://github.com/anikdc/raycasting/tree/v1). For displaying and drawing the structures I have used Pygame.

## Demo
